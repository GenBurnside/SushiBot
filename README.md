# SushiBot

SushiBot is an IRC bot written in Ruby that uses the [Cinch bot-building framework](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch).

A couple of plugins are enabled by default:

* Repsonse: replys "Hello, USER!" when someone types "hello"
* Haiku: returns a random haiku

Haiku were taken from a few different places, including [haiku-poetry.org](http://www.haiku-poetry.org/famous-haiku.html) and [carlsensei.com](http://www.carlsensei.com/classical/).
